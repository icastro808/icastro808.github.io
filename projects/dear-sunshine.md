<h2>Development</h2>
Dear Sunshine was created using React Bootstrap, Next.js, Typescript, and Prisma ORM over the span of one month. My team used Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM) to structure our project on GitHub, and divided the work between frontend and backend.
<br />
<br />

My contribution to this project mainly lied in backend development, and I was responsible for the following features:
<li>filtering system where users can add tags to their letters</li>
<li>moderation system to prevent users from creating letters or replies with inappropriate words or phrases</li>
<li>reaction system where users can react to each letter with one or more emojis</li>
<li>pagination for both letters and replies on the letter board</li>
<br />
I also contributed to frontend development as well, working with my teammates to achieve a consistent, clean look throughout our website.
